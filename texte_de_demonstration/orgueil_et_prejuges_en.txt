Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring 
his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching 
Pemberley; and was consequently resolved not to be out 
of sight of the inn the whole of that morning. But her 
conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their 
arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They had 
been walking about the place with some of their new 
friends, and were just returning to the inn to dress 
themselves for dining with the same family, when the

sound of a carriage drew them to a window, and they 
saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the 
street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery, 
guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree 
of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with 
the honour which she expected. Her uncle and aunt were 
all amazement; and the embarrassment of her manner 
as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many 
of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to
them a new idea on the business. Nothing had ever 
suggested it before, but they felt that there was no 
other way of accounting for such attentions from such 
a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece.
